Operating System have the 3 subsystems
        1) File, 2) Process, 3) Memory, 4) CPU Scheduling, 5) Hardware Abstraction

    1) File 
    2) Process
    3) Memory

# Storage Devices

    1) RAM & ROM Primary
    2) HDD Secondary


    # Four parts of ROM
        ROM
        E ROM
        P ROM
        EPE ROM


Microprocessor generate the data as per its


Cache Memory
    1) L1
    2) L2
    3) L3


# Concept of RAM (Program execution, .exe file)

# Microprocessor (ALU, CU, FPU)

# Fetch, Decode and Execute (Steps of program execution)



# Mono Kernel       (All management in one)
# Micro Kernel      (All management are in separate)
# Hybrid Kernel

# Advantages and Disadvantages Mono, Micro Kernel and Hybrid Kernel


# Have to know the 5 OS of Windows, Mac and Linux


# Auxilary data

    Algorithms

    1) Process Table
    2) U Pointer
    3) IIT
    4) U Area       1) Process Table, 2) File Table

# Process State Transition Diagram

# Kernel is always in to the active mode



# Sys Call Table for the systems Call


# Switches

    1) Mode Switch
    2) Context Switch


To maintain self integrity OS didnt switch from kernel mode

Preantion of OS in kernel mode



Stack 1) User, 2) Kernel, 3) Context


All sys calls have the table which sys call number and its address

Address Space => 

One system call didnt call internally another system call hence single stack frame is present in kernel stack



# Context Switch
    Its contains the vital vital information of running process


# Nice value


# Priority, Waiting Time, Cumulating Time
